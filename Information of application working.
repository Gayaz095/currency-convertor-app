The Navbar serves as the navigation hub for the application. The logo is displayed prominently at the top-left corner and is made interactive by linking it to the Home page. 

Each page features a container with a border, padding, and rounded corners, providing a clean and organized layout. 

The Home page acts as a gateway, displaying a welcome message or redirecting users to the Dashboard if they are logged in. 

The forms include input fields for username and password. The logic ensures that users cannot sign up or log in without filling in all required fields, prompting a message to do so. Upon successful sign-up, users are directed to the login page.

The Dashboard is the central feature where currency conversions take place.

Styling is applied using Bootstrap and custom CSS to create a visually appealing user interface. 

User feedback, in the form of alerts, provides informative messages about successful actions or prompts users to correct their input.

The Navbar includes a "Logout" button that securely logs users out of their accounts, providing a smooth transition between sessions.
